## Publication years with single-author papers
- Based on the memory provided, there are no single-author publications recorded. All listed publications include at least one co-author.

## Notes & Caveats
- This analysis is based solely on the entities and relations present in the provided memory graph. Many co-authors do not have affiliated institutions recorded in that memory. For a more complete institution-level mapping (and to accurately identify the institution with the most collaborators), additional data (e.g., each co-author's affiliation from publication metadata or external sources) would be needed.

## Next steps (optional)
- If you want, I can:
  1) Enrich the collaborator->institution mapping by querying publication metadata (e.g., from Google Scholar profiles or the papers' PDFs).
  2) Produce a network visualization (graph) of the co-authorship network.
  3) Add a CSV file to this repo listing collaborators, inferred institutions, and which publications they co-authored.
